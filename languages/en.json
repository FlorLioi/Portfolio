        "description": "My name is Florencia, I am 27 years old and I was born in Tandil, province of Buenos Aires. When I finished high school, I started a career in Initial Education, which I finished, but I decided to make a change in my life and really find out what I want to dedicate myself to. And I discovered a wonderful world which motivates me to continue developing myself every day as a professional and most importantly as a person. I am dedicated to Front End development and I am currently gaining experience in No code (Bubble) and ux ui design.",
